This is a problem set on AutoEncoders initially Forked from AI-For-Beginners Repo https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners 

Work your way through the Notebook AutoEncodersPyTorch.ipynb - Do as many of the extra exercises as time allows.
Some of the training takes around 15 mins so be patient.
